    API to manage the chores with the flatmates in a shared flat.

    # Concepts

    - **User**: Each person living in the same flat, a flatmate.
    - **Flat**: A flat. Each user and chore is assigned to a different flat. This API is multi-flat, it can manage the chores of multiple flats. The flat is selected by the `x-flat` header. For more info about the `x-flat` header, please read the [multiflat](#section/Concepts/Multiflat) section.
    - **Chore Type**: A defined chore that needs to be executed weekly in the flat. Each chore type will be assigned weekly to a different flatmate.
    - **Weekly chores**: Chores grouped by week.
    - **Week ID**: Weeks are identified by the year and the week number, like `2022.03` (the third week of 2022).
    - **Ticket**: Number of chores of a specific type that the user is owed. For more info, read the [tickets system](#section/Concepts/Tickets-system) section.

    ## Multiflat

    As said before, the flat is selected by the `x-flat` header. If the header is not supplied, it will take the default value (`default-flat`). This flat should be created by default and should not be used.

    To create a flat, ask the API manager (who has the admin token) to create a flat. You will be given the flat token, which you can use to register users, schedule weekly chores and more.

    ## Tickets system

    This API supports chore transfers. When a user transfers a chore to other user, a ticket also is transferred. A ticket is like a currency, +1 tickets means that the user is owed a chore (in the future another user will complete his chore), and -1 tickets means that the user owns a chore (in the future he will complete another user's chore).

    Diferent chore types are considered non equivalent, so a ticket of (the chore type) X can not be compensated with a ticket of type Y.

    # Authorization

    This API uses api key based authorization. There are 3 types of api keys with different auth levels. Each one of them contains the same permissions as the ones below and more specific permissions.

    1. **Admin token**: there is only one. It has permission to do anything, from creating a new flat to mark a chore as completed.
    2. **Flat token**: there is one for each flat. It has permission to manage the flat assigned and the users assigned to the flat.
    3. **User token**: there is one for each user. It has permission to act in name of the user, like transfering chores or completing chores.
